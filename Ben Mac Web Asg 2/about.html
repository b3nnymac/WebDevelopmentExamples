 <h2>Who am I?</h3>
<p> <img src="images/my-face.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt= "Me!" />
My name is Ben Maciorowski.  I currently pursuing Mount Royal University's BCIS.  
I've already obtained a Bachelors and Masters of arts in Film and Media Studies from the University of Alberta in Edmonton and
York University in Toronto, respectively. Check out <a href="project.html"> a fun video project</a> I worked on for a lark. The reason I've started this new program is because
 I enjoy technology and it's ability to enrich lives. I don't know specifically what I would like to with the BCIS, 
 but I would like to be involved with an organization that is concerned with environmental sustainability, food security, and 
 surround myself with progressive creative thinkers.  I have no desire to hold any position in the oil and gas industry.
 The reason I returned to Calgary was originally because my partner accepted a teaching contract at a Sikh school 
 in North East Calgary.  I was very reluctant to return to Calgary, but I am pleasantly surprised with the forwarder thinking
 I have encountered, although there is room for more.</p>
